    "\n",
    "### General instructions:\n",
    "* You should complete the Homework 2 using R-language.\n",
    "* Homework should be uploaded into Moodle as a zip file containing:\n",
    "    + Jupyter notebook and the html version of it \n",
    "    \n",
    "    or\n",
    "    \n",
    "    + .pdf file and commented R-script\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Jupyter notebook or the.pdf file  **should have a standard structure as any article in a refereed economic journal (introduction, data description, empirical methodology, results, conclusions, appendix with additional results)**. \n",
    "    + the length of your paper is less important; it can vary between 5-10 pages. Be concise (no lengthy essays, please), although, be sure to include all important things as we cannot second-guess your work. \n",
    "    + the content of the paper is decisive; it is important to demonstrate that you understand the concepts covered during semester and you are able to apply them     \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Name of the uploaded file should be:\n",
    "    + \"HW_Student1surname_Student2surname_Student3surname.zip\"\n",
    "* **Only one member of each group should submit the solution.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Inter-group discussion in solving the assignment is encouraged. However, each group is supposed to write their own answers in their own words. \n",
    "* Note that not only numerical results (40%) but also verbal comments (40% points) and appearance (20% points) are parts of the evaluation.\n",
    "* Not including code or sending only code will result in a **50% penalty** . \n",
    "\n",
    "Homework is subject to late penalties \n",
    "* 20% for the first day\n",
    "* 50% for the second day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignments are not accepted after the second day.\n",

    "### Set-up\n",
    "In the Homework 1, you were asked to download various data commonly used in the emprical asset pricing:\n",
    "* daily adjusted close price and volume data from www.finance.yahoo.com\n",
    "* Market Capitalization and Book Value per Share data from www.macrotrends.net\n",
    "* Sample period: 01.01.2007 - 31.12.2020 \n",
    "\n",
    "* In case you were able to download the required data, you will be using them also in Homework 2. \n",
    "* In case you were not able to download the data, you can use data stored in the Moodle, i.e. file \"Asset_Pricing_HW_2_data.RData\". In this case you should select firms that were assigned to your group in Homework 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Empirical Problem\n",
    "In the homework you will demonstrate all the theoretical knowledge and empirical skills gained through the semester. Using financial market data you will \n",
    "* sort stocks into various portfolios, \n",
    "* examine time-series properties of the formed portfolios, \n",
    "* examine cross-sectional variation in portfolios and comment on importance of the sorting variables,  \n",
    "* use the Fama-MacBeth regressions and Fama-French-Carhart-Pastor-Stambaugh factor model to assess the performance of the sorting variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In the portfolio analysis you will use 3 sorting variables to create various portfolios. These variables are following:\n",
    "* Beta\n",
    "* Size\n",
    "* one of the Book-to-Market ratio/Momentum/Short-term-reversal/Illiquidity/Skewness/Volatility\n",
    "     + to each group the sorting variable was randomly assigned using the following code"
